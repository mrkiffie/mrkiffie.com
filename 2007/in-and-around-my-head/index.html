what good is out there? all i see portrayed on the silver screen is filled with hate and greed. good is this ideal that seems to be elusive. selfishness: it has its grasp around the throats of this generation, we are brought up not being corrected, believing that it is all about me, myself and what i can gain. no! this must stop. i shall be a blessing. i will not be a blackhole, consuming all that comes my way, but i’ll be a vessel in which this blessing that i’ve received will be transferred to the people of this world. and i don’t want to be selfish and limit it to the members of my social group, or to my colleagues, or my “racial” group, or my nation, my continent, the young or the old, or those in between. may this blessing that i’ve received, be passed on to every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues. this is the cry of my wounded heart. selflessness: this is the centre of true love: seeking the highest possible good for someone else, even at a cost to you.</p><p>now may you, prove to this generation and the ones to come that good is not just an ideal and that we can make a difference in lives, and be a blessing selflessly.</p></blockquote></article></main><hr class="screen-reader-text"><footer role="contentinfo"><ul><li><a href="/" title="Go to the home page">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about/" title="Information about me">About</a></li><li><a href="http://codepen.io/mrkiffie" title="View some of my creations on Codepen">Codepen</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mrkiffie" title="Follow my involvement in various open source projects on Github">Github</a></li></ul><small><span>-- .- -.. .</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span>.-- .. - ....</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span>.-.. --- ...- .</span></small><p>&copy;<span class="screen-reader-text">Copyright</span> 2011-2016 Kiffie&nbsp;Liversage</p></footer><script src="/assets/js/main-86dcd09ef150f541e3afa2c9e9a30a26.js"></script><script>(function(s,i,m,p,l,e,r){s['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=l;s[l]=s[l]||function(){(s[l].q=s[l].q||[]).push(arguments)},s[l].l=1*new Date();e=i.createElement(m),r=i.getElementsByTagName(m)[0];e.async=1;e.src=p;r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-24126980-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
