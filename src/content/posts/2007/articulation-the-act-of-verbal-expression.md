I struggle to articulate anything that I’ve never explained before, writing has such a lack of options when it comes to communication, all tone is lost, the rhythm and timing have no role to play. It be easier for me to use my facial expressions and the large array of strange sounds to communicate how I feel. Choosing from a list of words be easy, yet still doesn’t do it justice. I notice details at the most random of times, process most things logically, feels like there is a great divide within me, between my heart and my head. Trying to learn how to express the wealth that is stored up in my heart. and maybe somewhere along the way I’ll see how it changes from my mind speaking to my soul. All it takes is a bit of time…
