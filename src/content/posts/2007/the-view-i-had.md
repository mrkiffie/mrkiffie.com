this was the view i had on my neighbours, that they where living for what they could gain, that as long as it didn’t require responsibility, that there was not a problem or way that it could affect them, they would not get involved. how true this is about me. all that i do is based on how it affects me. maybe, i’ll someday be basing things continueously on a more selfless foundation, where i have reached a point of laying down my own rights and fighting for those of others.
