### Who are you?


As stated in the title, my name is KiFFiE, I’m proudly South African and grew up on a farm.


Since 2004, I’ve been a full-time volunteer with a [non-profit, non-government organization](http://ywammuizenberg.org) in Cape Town – what that means is, I don’t get/haven’t ever got a salary.


I love music, computers as well as teaching what I know. My strengths include being strategic, analytical and deliberative. I’m also a strong leader and enjoy learning – I’ve been described as a sponge; picking up information and spreading it everywhere.


More than existence, I desire to live an abundantly full and satisfying life.


I have found that working with people, even though it is one of the most challenging things, is also one of the most rewarding things. I like to develop people, to challenge them to growth in all areas of their life; spiritually, intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically.


I love asking questions, especially the difficult ones because I find questions the quickest way to reach truth.


### What of you do?


I am a personal coach and goal strategist to the young people who are involved with the training programs offered.


As a musician and singer, I not only play in a band, but organize awareness concerts about injustices and teach music and guitar to those wanting to learn.


I use my skills with computers to serve the other volunteer staff and students, whether it is tracking down their computer’s latest virus or coding a website, I do what I can to serve.
