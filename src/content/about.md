My name is Kiffie Liversage. I'm a web developer and musician located in beautiful and diverse city of Cape Town, South Africa.


### Web Development

I'm a web developer specializing in javascript. I also love the semantic web, progressive enhancement, accessibility and CSS.

This is how the timeline goes:

- 1997 - 2003: Programmed in Pascal throughout my schooling
- 2006 - 2008: Started web development doing simple static sites
- 2009 - 2012: Started using php to create dynamic sites and developing custom wordpress sites (freelance)
- 2012 - 2014: Web developer at [Creative Spark](http://www.creativespark.co.za/)
- 2014 - 2016: Web developer at [Spree](https://www.spree.co.za)
- 2017 - current: Software Engineer at [Kurtosys](https://www.kurtosys.com/)


### Music

I play multiple instruments, but prefer playing bass in a band context and thoroughly enjoy the creative process, composing original songs and all round fun music.


### Speaking

Teaching, telling stories, sharing experiences and passing on to that which I have learnt on my journey is another thing I enjoy.
