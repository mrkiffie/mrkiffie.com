My name is Kiffie Liversage. I'm a front-end developer and musician located in beautiful and diverse city of Cape Town, South Africa.



### Front-end Development

I'm a front-end developer specializing in javascript. I also love the semantic web, progressive enhancement, accessibility and CSS. 

This is how the timeline goes:

- 1997 - 2003: Programmed in Pascal throughout my schooling
- 2006 - 2008: Started web development doing simple static sites
- 2009 - 2012: Started using php to create dynamic sites and developing custom wordpress sites (freelance)
- 2012 - 2014: Front-end developer at [Creative Spark](http://www.creativespark.co.za/)
- 2014 - Present: Front-end developer at [Spree](http://www.spree.co.za)


### Music


I play multiple instruments, but prefer playing bass in a band context and thoroughly enjoy the creative process, composing original songs and all round fun music.


### Speaking


Teaching, telling stories, sharing experiences and passing on to that which I have learnt on my journy is another thing I enjoy.
