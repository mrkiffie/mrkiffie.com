My strengths include being strategic, analytical and deliberative. I’m also a strong leader and enjoy learning – I’ve been described as a sponge; picking up information and spreading it everywhere.</p><p>More than existence, I desire to live an abundantly full and satisfying life.</p><p>I have found that working with people, even though it is one of the most challenging things, is also one of the most rewarding things. I like to develop people, to challenge them to growth in all areas of their life; spiritually, intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically.</p><p>I love asking questions, especially the difficult ones because I find questions the quickest way to reach truth.</p><h3 id=what-of-you-do>What of you do?</h3><p>I am a personal coach and goal strategist to the young people who are involved with the training programs offered.</p><p>As a musician and singer, I not only play in a band, but organize awareness concerts about injustices and teach music and guitar to those wanting to learn.</p><p>I use my skills with computers to serve the other volunteer staff and students, whether it is tracking down their computer’s latest virus or coding a website, I do what I can to serve.</p><h3 id=how-can-i-find-out-more>How can I find out more?</h3><p>Please feel free to explore my site.
