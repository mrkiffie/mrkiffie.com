After a while we put up these safeguard to keep us from getting hurt again or at least minimizing the risk there of. But time goes on, sometimes healing these wounds and causing us to let our guard down. And before you’re any the more wiser, life throws you a curve ball and all attempts to deal with it fail. You lose!</p><p>Why these reflections on loosing? I just lost. Nothing serious, just a small battle with technology. My laptop has been showing signs that it is on it’s way out and today I got another BSOD – Now I’ve been able to recover from the dozens of these that I have faced over the last number of years. Yet this one has gotten me down. I think this time it is the hard drive giving in.</p><p>In my attempt to put this loosing streak behind me, I’m in the process of doing a re-install to see if it isn’t perhaps just that my installation was corrupted. Luckily, well not by luck, but by planning for this day to come, I’ve kept good backups of all my critical data.</p><p>My Laptop celebrated it’s 6th birthday less than a month ago and as with anything that someone uses regularly for such a long time, we grow attached. When I got it, it was one of the best, and although technology has moved on, I’m still attached to it. I love everything about it; its keyboard layout, its size, its innards… battery is a little weak but hey, we all loose energy as we get older.</p><p>So now I’m busy re-installing – hoping that this is not the end. I don’t want it to end, (I do know that this is an unrealistic expectation) I just don’t want it to end.</p><p>I’ll be back with an update of how it goes.</p></article></main><hr class="screen-reader-text"><footer role="contentinfo"><ul><li><a href="/" title="Go to the home page">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about/" title="Information about me">About</a></li><li><a href="http://codepen.io/mrkiffie" title="View some of my creations on Codepen">Codepen</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mrkiffie" title="Follow my involvement in various open source projects on Github">Github</a></li></ul><small><span>-- .- -.. . </span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>.-- .. - .... </span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>.-.. --- ...- .</span></small><p>&copy;<span class="screen-reader-text">Copyright</span> 2011-2016 Kiffie&nbsp;Liversage</p></footer><script src="/assets/js/main-32ce3efb9c984dcd0f12c254d011c135.js"></script><script>(function(s,i,m,p,l,e,r){s['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=l;s[l]=s[l]||function(){(s[l].q=s[l].q||[]).push(arguments)},s[l].l=1*new Date();e=i.createElement(m),r=i.getElementsByTagName(m)[0];e.async=1;e.src=p;r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-24126980-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
